# MASS-CUDA
About MASS: MASS, an acronym for Multi-Agent Spatial Simulation, is a sophisticated parallel 
computing library initially geared for large-scale ABM simulations. These simulations encompass 
diverse domains such as physical, biological, social, and strategic interactions. It operates on the 
principle of multi-agents, with each agent acting as an autonomous simulation entity within a virtual 
space.

## MASS CUDA Extension
As a significant part of this project, I am enhancing MASS to be compatible with 
CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture), NVIDIA's parallel computing platform and application 
programming interface. This adaptation, termed MASS CUDA, exploits GPUs' vast parallel processing 
capabilities to significantly boost the performance of simulations, especially those involving intricate 
interactions between multiple entities.

## My Role
Undertaking a pioneering role as the lead and sole developer in this Master's Capstone project, my 
central goal is to augment the Multi-Agent Spatial Simulation (MASS) library. This enhancement 
focuses on adapting the library to operate efficiently not only on CPUs but also on GPUs. The project's 
foundation is the integration of complex Agent-Based Models (ABMs) across both single and multiple 
Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) in a grid server environment.
